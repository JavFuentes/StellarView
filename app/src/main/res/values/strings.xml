    <string name="help_one_day_ago_message">Due to the location of the International Date Line, countries and territories to the west of this line (in the Western Pacific region) experience a new day before the United States. These places include, but are not limited to:\n\nNew Zealand, Australia, Fiji, Tonga, Samoa, Kiribati Islands and part of Antarctica that falls within the corresponding time zone (UTC+13 and UTC+14)\n\nDue to Earth\'s rotation, these places enter a new day earlier than the United States and most other countries in the world. However, time changes due to daylight saving time and other considerations may affect this list, which will result in an error when querying the photo of the day that has not yet arrived.\n\nIf you encounter a 404 error when trying to load the photo of the day, consider enabling this option, which will subtract one day from the current date..</string>

    <string name='onu_statement'>The UN\'s statement on the shift from \"global warming\" to \"global boiling\" suggests an intensification and acceleration of the effects of climate change.</string>
    <string name="introduction">"Global boiling" in a climate context indicates a critical point that precedes extreme and devastating climatic events. Despite efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, they continue to rise, exacerbating phenomena such as heatwaves, floods, and wildfires.\n\nThese events not only harm nature but also impact society in terms of health, infrastructure, and the economy. Faced with this crisis, global action focused on mitigation and adaptation is essential to ensure a sustainable future.</string>
    <string name="content1">Climate change, intensified by human actions such as burning fossil fuels, is a central concern in contemporary science. There are various sources that confirm its existence and severity. Among the most prominent are the IPCC Report, the research from NOAA and NASA, and various reports from organizations like the WMO and the U.S. National Academy of Sciences. \n\nThese sources, along with scientific articles and NGOs, provide vast information and evidence about this phenomenon. </string>
    <string name="content2">The fight against global warming requires both collective and individual efforts. Collectively, it is vital to implement emission reduction policies, invest in renewable energies, promote energy efficiency, and encourage reforestation and sustainable agricultural practices. Education and research into climate solutions are also essential. \n\nIndividually, we can contribute by reducing, reusing, recycling, using energy and water efficiently, opting for sustainable transportation, reducing meat consumption, especially beef, supporting green policies and businesses, and participating in reforestation. Every action adds to the global effort for a more sustainable future.</string>

    <string name="news_subtitle2">"Some people believe that climate change is not real or that humans are not directly responsible</string>
    <string name="news_subtitle3">We must take action!</string>
